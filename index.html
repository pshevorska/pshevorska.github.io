  <p>Liana is an Assistant Professor of French in the
<a href="https://westpoint.edu/academics/academic-departments/foreign-languages" target="_blank">Department of Foreign Languages</a>
at the
<a href="https://westpoint.edu" target="_black">United States Military Academy at West Point</a>.
She earned her Ph.D. in French from
<a href="https://www.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Princeton University</a>,
following an M.A. in French Studies (2011) and a B.A. in Education (French &amp; Russian, 2009) from the
<a href="https://www.arizona.edu" target="_blank">University of Arizona</a>.
She broadly specializes in 20th-21st-century French and Francophone studies,
with a focus on migration, transnational studies, multilingualism, identity,
and the works of contemporary migrant authors from historically non-francophone countries.
Her forthcoming book chapter
“L’espace dédalesque de Vassilis Alexakis : errance, (im)mobilité et fabulation dans <em>L’Enfant grec</em>”
is scheduled for publication in <em>Vassilis Alexakis : chemins croisés</em> with the Presses Universitaires de Rennes.</p>
<p>Prior to joining West Point, she taught French language and culture at Princeton University
and the University of Arizona. From 2015 to 2018, she taught French/Francophone literature, grammar,
and creative writing in Bryn Mawr College’s summer study abroad program (Institut d’Avignon).</p>
<p>Over the last two years, Liana has been serving as course director for the two-semester
Elementary French I &amp; II sequence at West Point. In this role, she implemented a new textbook,
developed new pedagogical materials (exams, syllabi, projects), and provided training and mentorship
to junior instructors who teach 130 cadets across 8 sections. In addition to basic language courses,
she has designed and taught courses in French culture and French/Francophone literatures, such as
“French Civilization from the Middle Ages to the Belle Époque,” “French Literature from Romanticism to Twitterature,”
“Modern Odysseys: Between Two Languages and Cultures,” and “Alterity: The Marvelous, the Fantastic, the Surrealist.”
Liana is currently designing a course entitled “French Society through Song,” which she will teach at West Point in Spring 2022.</p>
<p>Dr. Pshevorska also serves as an academic counselor and supports Cadets as adviser of the French Forum.</p>
